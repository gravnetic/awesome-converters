# awesome-converters

I started off in the world of maps. That world is lucky enough to have a thing called [GDAL](https://gdal.org/): a big community effort around a parser, generator, and converter for all the geospatial formats. It's not totally exhaustive but it's pretty close! Some domains have this thing and others don't. This is a list of those things.

I'm trying to just name _one per domain_ - this isn't an exhaustive list of all the converts. Just trying to highlight the one ultra-converter: if it exists!

- **Geospatial, maps, spatial data**: [GDAL](https://gdal.org/)
- **Text documents**: [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
- **Images**: [GraphicksMagic `convert`](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/convert.html)
- **Audio**: [XLD](https://tmkk.undo.jp/xld/index_e.html) for lossless audio
- **Video**: [[ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)

### Are there universal converters for these?

- 3D CAD Formats
- Tabular data
- JSON/YAML and other structured data
